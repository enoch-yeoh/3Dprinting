# 3Dprinting
These are 2 projects that I have done with our 3D printer at home.
I think the ability to create and make things is fascinating, especially with the technology that is available now.

The next one is done using a CAD software fusion360.
Because I am a Lego fan, I 3D printed a lego brick.
You can look at the attached lego brick file called lego v2.3mf.
